# Documentation

  Once you set the installation, you can start the application through a browser. You'll see full deck of cards (52)
and the 9 possible opponents with no hands picked yet. Using the shown cards, you set the player(s)' hands 
and/or the flop, turn, river. There you go! Now you will see the odds of winning of all the players with cards set.
  If you misplaced a card, you simply click again on it and it is gone.
